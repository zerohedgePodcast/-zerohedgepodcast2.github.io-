title: VS Code extension that lets you open the MDN docs of a CSS property
---

After releasing [my first VS Code extension](https://dzhavat.github.io/2019/08/13/vs-code-extension-that-shows-the-initial-value-of-a-css-property.html) last week, I got an idea for another one. This one lets you open the MDN docs of a CSS property. Quite simple! The link appears on hover.

The extension is conveniently called [CSS to MDN](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzhavat.css-to-mdn).

Here‚Äôs a demo:

Before making the extension, if I wanted to open the docs of `background-size`, for example, I‚Äôd switch to a browser, open a new tab, search for something like ‚Äúmdn bkg size‚Äù, then click on the first result.

With this extension I don‚Äôt have to go through these steps. I can simply hover a property and click on the link. Nice, isn‚Äôt it? üòâ

If you work with CSS, please give it a try. I hope you find it useful.
