Itâ€™s that time of the year again! The [ngVikings conference](https://www.ngvikings.org/) is here. Itâ€™s fully remote this time due to the global corona pandemic so you get to experience it from the comfort of your home. That doesnâ€™t make it any less valuable! Quite the opposite! There are still amazing speakers delivering great content over the next couple of days. You can watch the live stream on the [official website](https://www.ngvikings.org/).

Just like [last year](https://dzhavat.github.io/2019/05/27/links-to-all-slides-from-ngvikings.html), Iâ€™m going to collect all the slides in one place so you can spend less time searching and more time learning! ðŸ˜‰
