title: CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet VS Code extension hit 10k installs
---

A couple of days ago my [CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzhavat.css-flexbox-cheatsheet) VS Code extension hit 10k installs! The initial release was exactly six months ago. That means that, on average, it was installed roughly 55 times per day! Pretty wild! So far it‚Äôs gotten five reviews, all positive, rating it with five starts.

This is a huge milestone for me. I had never imagined so many people will want to try it. I‚Äôm thankful to every one of them. Hopefully the extension helped them learn something about flexbox and, as a result, had an easier time working with it.

I‚Äôm wondering, though, how do people use the extension? How many times do they open it after install? Only once and never again? Just a handful? More? Do they find the illustrations easy to understand? Can I do something to make them even more useful? An an author, I miss this kind of feedback and am thinking of ways to start asking for it. The reviews are one obvious place but not that many are willing to give one. And besides that, the reviews are not really suitable for longer discussions. So if you use the extension and have some comments about it, please let me know [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dzhavatushev).

### What‚Äôs next?

I recently came up with the idea of showing the illustration of how a property works already in the hover popup. Something like this:

No need to open the whole cheatsheet to see how what a property does!

Instead of opening the whole cheatsheet to look for a specific property, you‚Äôd be able to see it in the hover. This will bring the cheatsheet even closer to where you actually need it and hopefully make it even more useful. What do you think about it?

I‚Äôm currently working on it, polishing some final details. Who knows, it might come out soon üòÄ
