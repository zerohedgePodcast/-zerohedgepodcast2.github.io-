## Uses

I got inspired to create this page from a [post on DEV.to](https://dev.to/nickytonline/do-you-have-a-uses-page-5b82). I like the idea of sharing what‚Äôs in my toolbox as a front-end developer. Initially I wanted to share that in a blog post but I guess having it as a dedicated page works better. Feel free to take whatever tools you like. I promise to not charge you anything.
